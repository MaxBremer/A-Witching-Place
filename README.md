This project, temporarily dubbed "A Witching Place", is currently an experiment in procedural terrain 
generation and gameplay possibilities therein. 
The code is fairly well documented if you'd like to explore it in Assets/Scripts, otherwise feel free
to open the project in Unity and edit/test it to your hearts content.
Movement is WASD + mouse, space to jump, Y to spawn in a "test structure", left click to break a close 
voxel, and right click to add one.
